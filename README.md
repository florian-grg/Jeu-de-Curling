# Projet image2 - Curling Couriot

## Getting started

The project have several classes and dependancies. If you want to contribute to the project you need to have the following ones installed : 
- OpenCV : 4.10.0
- JavaFX : We configured it to be compatible with the last version installed on your Java Environment

## Project State
The project is fully functional and commented. It follows the JavaDoc standard and therefore provides dynamic documentation, provided you have a compatible extension to VS Code (implemented as standard in Eclipse).

## Possible future improvements
- Upgrade of graphics available
- Allowing more than 2 players to play
